# azure-foundations

The aim of Azure Foundations is to simplify the overhead of managaging a new environment while also reducing the risk of elevated permissions that are required for some of the core foundational work that is needed.

## Scope

Azure Foundations will aim to:

- create management groups
- move subscriptions into their required management groups
- assign built in policy set definitions (inititaves) to management groups.
- Outline the foundations for adding additional policies and inititaves via a dedicated workflow

## Out of scope
